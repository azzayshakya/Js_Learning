# 🚀 Js_Learning  

### 👋 Welcome to My JavaScript Mastery Journey!  

Hey there! I'm **Ajay Shakya** (aka [azzayshakya](https://github.com/azzayshakya)) and this repo is my digital notebook for mastering JavaScript.  
I'm currently working as a **professional developer** (yep, got the job 💼), but guess what? I realized there's always more to learn! So, I'm restarting my JS learning journey alongside my job. 😎  

### 📚 What's This About?  

In this repo, I'll be pushing my daily progress as I dive deep into the world of JavaScript. But hey, since I'm juggling work too, I might skip some basics here and there. 😅  
I’m following an amazing playlist from [Harshit Vashisth](https://www.youtube.com/@Harshitvashisth) to level up my JS skills.
